- This is what I've been trying to do haha

Note:
There is a bug where I can't shoot more bullets after a while. Even though I should be able to.

How it satisfies requirements
- level 1 introduces ability to push around blocks. Which is a physics interactions
- level 2 introduces the ability to bounce bullets off walls 
- level 3 (still in progress) introduces "space" like physics or icy floor like movement
How all your assets are created
- All of the pictures were made on a pixel art making website.
